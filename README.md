📈 Stock Market Prediction Using Deep Learning
This project focuses on predicting stock prices using Deep Learning techniques, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. The goal is to analyze historical stock data and build a model that can forecast future trends with high accuracy.

🚀 Features
Real-time stock price data collection using APIs (e.g., Yahoo Finance)
Data preprocessing including normalization and feature engineering
LSTM-based deep learning model for time series prediction
Visualization of predictions vs actual stock prices
Configurable for any stock symbol and time period

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python
Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
TensorFlow / Keras
Scikit-learn
Yahoo Finance API (or any other stock data source)

📊 Dataset
Historical stock price data for selected companies fetched via Yahoo Finance or CSV file. Includes:
Date
Open
High
Low
Close
Volume

🔍 Model Highlights
LSTM model trained on closing price data
Trained with Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function
Evaluation based on RMSE and visual accuracy
Future prediction graph generation

✅ Results
To run this project you should open the app.py in the integral terminal and enter  python .\app.py
Demonstrates promising prediction accuracy for short-term forecasts
Graphical comparison between predicted and actual prices
Extendable for multi-feature and multi-stock prediction
